            <p class="info">
                I have been a fleet Specialist at Saraji and Daunia in BHP the past three years. I currently control mine-sites remotely optimizing production, amending data and organizing daily procedures for circuits across site. My role includes being the first response for emergencies and providing feedback to site teams regarding performance and areas for improvement. I have produced multiple training documents in my field that have gone on to be published, controlled BHP documents. I have also led and completed Root Cause Analyses for the company. I've attained a trainer assessor certificate, first aid certificate and completed an emergency response training course. I have also started studying computer programming after being selected to join a sponsored coding course. Throughout the 6 month course I will gain experience building websites, programs and apps using VS (css and html), python, javascript and Django.

                I love being apart of projects, big and small. Making a change for the better is what I'm all about. So far, my coding course has just started. My experience in programming may seem a little limited. BUT, this is just the start of what I hope to be a long career. I have confidence that this list will grow with projects that I am proud of - watch this space! My first project accomplished (so far) is:
            <ul id="project-list">
                <li>Created Portfolio Website</li>
            </ul>
