                    I have been a fleet Specialist at Saraji and Daunia in BHP the past three years. I currently control mine-sites remotely optimizing production, amending data and organizing daily procedures for circuits across site. My role includes being the first response for emergencies and providing feedback to site teams regarding performance and areas for improvement.
I have produced multiple training documents in my field that have gone on to be published, controlled BHP documents. I have also led and completed Root Cause Analyses for the company.
I've attained a trainer assessor certificate, first aid certificate and completed an emergency response training course. 

I have also started studying computer programming after being selected to join a sponsored coding course. Throughout the 6 month course I will gain experience building websites, programs and apps using VS (css and html), python, javascript and Django.
